As an AI, I'm unable to create images or directories. However, I can guide you on how to do it.

For the file `website/images/carousel`, it's not a file but a directory where you should store the images for the carousel. You can do this manually by creating a folder named `carousel` inside the `images` directory and then upload the images you want to display in the carousel.

If you were to do this programmatically, you could use a server-side language like Node.js with the `fs` module to create directories and save images. However, this is beyond the scope of the current task.
