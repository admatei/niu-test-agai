As an AI, I'm unable to create directories or files. However, I can guide you on how to do it. For the file `website/images/books`, it's not a file but a directory where you should store all the images related to the books that will be displayed on the website. 

You can create this directory using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p website/images/books
```

Then, you can add images to this directory by simply copying them into it. For example, if you have an image named `book1.jpg` in your current directory, you can move it to the `books` directory like this:

```bash
mv book1.jpg website/images/books
```

Remember, this directory should contain all the images of the books that you want to display on the "Books" page of your website.
